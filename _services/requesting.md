Medneed.org is being optimized for professional engagements that enable life scientists and clinicians to have access to multimodal data, specialized knowledge, and hard-to-find experimental and experiential medical information. 

The aim is to provide a comprehensive source of multimodal datasets for researchers and developers working on neuroregeneration and seeking to develop therapies for stroke treatment.

Are you a researcher looking for specific datasets to enhance your stroke research? Medneed.org facilitates the process of connecting with data owners to foster collaborative efforts.

##  How it Works:

1. Submit a Request: Share details about your research project and the specific type of data you are seeking.

2. Connect with Data Owners: Our platform allows you to connect with institutions and researchers who possess relevant datasets.

3. Facilitated Collaboration: Collaborate with data owners to access the data you need for your research, fostering a collaborative and interdisciplinary approach.

If you are in need of specific stroke-related datasets, let us help you find the right collaborators.
