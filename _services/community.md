Join us as we work with communities to ensure **timely treatment and recovery** for more patients.

The average time to treatment and eventual recovery for an emergency like stroke is unacceptably too long especially in Africa. 

The percentage of patients who get treated within the optimal four-hour window for a stroke is nearly zero in many African communities. 

This is just unacceptable. 

Together, we have to make very possible effort to ensure that stroke patients can get the acute care they need as fast as possible for improved treatment outcomes. 

To this end, some of our additional efforts include helping:


### Make healthcare systems stroke-ready 

We work with partners to conduct training on medications and procedures to enable medical facilities and providers deliver timely medical care to stroke patients. 

From equipment and learning tools to clinical trials and research, we work with partners to support medical care providers at every level with resources needed to be stroke-ready.


### Find medical facilities and providers 

We help providers and patients and their families locate medical care facilities and providers of various procedures needed for stroke treatment. 

We are mapping medical facilities and providers based on location and specialties/subspecialties to make it easier for stroke patients to get any acute and chronic care.


### Provide financing for patient payments 

We provide financing to ensure that patients who need help can get treatments so that no acute stroke patient is refused timely treatment because of funds. 

Through the medical provider, Medneed takes care of urgent medication costs for those who cannot afford it and the patient can pay back later over time.


### Make more people stroke-aware 

We educate the general public on the signs of stroke and steps to take for more rapid response and timely treatment.

### Provide routine guidance and support

We help and guide providers and patients and their families along the care journey to ensure the patient is getting the right care at every stage as fast as possible.
