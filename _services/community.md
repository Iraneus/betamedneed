Join our effort with communities to ensure **timely treatment and recovery** for more patients.

![Medical Community](/images/illustrations/patient.jpg)
 

The average time spent before treatment for an emergency like a stroke is unacceptably too long in Africa. 

In many African communities, the percentage of patients who get treated within the optimal four-hour window for a stroke treatment is nearly zero. 

This is unacceptable since time is everything for a stroke treatment. The earlier the treatment, the higher the chances of recovery.

Together, we are working to ensure that stroke patients can get the care they need as fast as possible for improved treatment outcomes. 

Some of our additional efforts include:


### Making healthcare systems stroke ready 

We work with partners to conduct training on medications and procedures to enable medical facilities and providers deliver timely medical care to stroke patients. 

From equipment and learning tools to clinical trials and research, we work with partners to support medical care providers at every level with resources needed to be stroke ready.


### Locating medical facilities and providers 

We help providers and patients and their families find medical care facilities and providers of various procedures needed in stroke treatment. 

We are mapping medical facilities and providers based on location and specialties/subspecialties to make it easier for stroke patients to quickly find any acute and chronic care.

### Making more people stroke aware 

We educate the general public on the signs of stroke and steps to take for more rapid response and timely treatment.

### Providing routine guidance and support

We help and guide providers and patients and their families along the care journey to ensure the patient is getting the right care at every stage as fast as possible.
