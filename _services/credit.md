The MedNeed Credit enables registered medical facilities to request for **credit facilities** whenever they need it to make payments for medical equipment and supplies.

MedNeed has an extensive credit scheme with financing from MedNeed and third-party financing partners on our peer-to-peer financing platform.

Qualified users can request credit facilities anytime they need them to procure medicines and medical equipment.

The credit facility ensures that users can have what they need to take care of their patients when they need it.

The credit facility also benefits the vendors since they can now sell more to the users for improved medical care delivery.

The credit facility comes with a service fee which is a percentage of the credit facility needed.

Contact MedNeed support to request.
