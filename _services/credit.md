With the MedNeed Credit, eligible medical facilities can always get a **credit facility** whenever they need it to make payments for medicines and supplies.

Users can get credit directly from MedNeed and from third-party financing partners on the MedNeed peer-to-peer financing network.

This helps ensure that users can have what they need to take care of their patients when they need it.

This also benefits vendors since they can now sell more to the users for improved medical care delivery.

Contact MedNeed support to make request.
