With MedNeed Credit, eligible medical facilities can readily get a **credit facility** to make payments whenever they need it.

Users can get credit/loans directly from MedNeed and from third-party financing partners on the MedNeed peer-to-peer financing network.

This also benefits vendors since they can now sell more to the users for improved medical care delivery.

Contact MedNeed support to make request.
