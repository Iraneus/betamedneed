**Cardiovascular Disease and Stroke Risk** 

Check for stroke and cardiovascular disease risk with preventive health screenings for these diseases.

### Atrial Fibrillation (AFib):
A 6-lead electrocardiogram (EKG) is performed by placing sensors on the arms and legs to screen for Atrial Fibrillation. AFib can lead to blood clots, stroke, and heart failure, and other heart-related complications.
