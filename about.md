Imagine a world where every medical facility can potentially have access to "almost" everything they need to take care of patients. Maybe this seems outrightly impossible if not crazy to think about? Well maybe or maybe not.

Alright, what if every duly registered medical facility can be enabled to readily have access to "most" of the things they need to provide quality medical care? Perhaps this seems more plausible. At least, provided that what they need is available somewhere close by or easily reachable. 

In any case the aim essentially is how do we ensure that more people can readily have access to quality medical care when they need it.

And since December 2019, we have been actively testing and trying various models to try to figure out how we could most sustainably work towards achieving this. Be sure this has been challenging. Having to work night and day and spending a significant amount of resources in the process.

Now after lots of stress and pivoting along the way, the good thing is we are arriving at a model we think will work. At least for now. The feedback so far has been mostly impressive. Although some people have their reservations. But then we think we can run and fly with what we now have.

And if there are places in the world where a lot more work is needed to improve access to quality medical care it is in many countries of Africa. So we are focusing on Africa. We believe we can transform access to quality medical care across Africa.

An important thing and which has made our work more challenging is that we wanted our model to be very scalable as fast as possible. So we can have an open playbook and can quickly and sustainably launch in any location where our solutions are needed most.This means we can deploy and start something almost anywhere in Africa right now.

That said, we have a lot to build and automate. We have a lot more to learn and fine-tune even as we continue to build our core solutions. Right now, we are inviting every medical facility to let us know how we can help them do better. Every medical facility can reach out and tell us what they need most so we can work together and possibly help them have access to it either right away or in no distant time. We are equally inviting partner organizations such as vendors and financial institutions who believe in our mission to join us.

We are also hiring. We are inviting people who are passionate about improving access to quality medical care and who believe they can work to make this happen to reach out to us. We are earnestly waiting.

MedNeed provides medical facilities and professionals with payment options for the things they need. At MedNeed, we are relentlessly focused on helping improve outcomes at medical facilities and reduce stress for medical professionals. We are obsessed with whatever will help medical facilities and professionals provide quality medical care for more people.

We believe that as we make it easier and faster for providers to have the the things they need for their patients from the right source, we will greatly increase the availability and use of genuine medical products in more communities while removing unnecessary costs. This naturally translates to overall more affordable and timely medical care in more communities and better health outcomes for more families.
