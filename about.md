With a current focus on neuroregeneration and stroke treatment, Medneed.org brings together researchers, clinicians, and organizations working on different aspects of neurology and stroke treatment to share and exchange data and ideas, helping accelerate the discovery and development of therapeutic interventions for neuroregeneration and stroke recovery.

We are building a benchmark multimodal dataset reference system, encompassing clinical and pre-clinical data and key biomarkers, including neuroimaging, therapeutic entities, and multi-omics data such as genetic profiles, proteomic data, and metabolomic signatures crucial for neuroregeneration and stroke recovery.
