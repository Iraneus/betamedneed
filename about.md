It takes years to discover new medicines and then takes like "ages", if ever, for some medicines to reach clinicians in many parts of the world like Africa. 

While cures may exist, in some cases, clinicians may not just know that the therapies they are looking for exist, let alone have access to cures.

Imagine a world where more providers can readily have access to the medicines and medical supplies they need to deliver care especially in more local communities.

At Medneed, we are building a simple way for providers to discover and acquire better medicines for better health outcomes.
