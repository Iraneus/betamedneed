What if every medical care provider can readily have access to most of the things they need to provide quality medical care?

Since December 2019, we have been actively testing and trying various models to figure out how to sustainably work towards this goal. 

This has been significantly challenging. We have had to work night and day and spent a significant amount of resources in the process.

Essentially, the aim is to ensure that more people can readily have access to quality medical care when they need it.

After lots of work and pivoting along the way, we now have a model we think will work, at least for now. The feedback has so far been impressive, and we believe we can run and fly with what we currently have.

Now, if there are places in the world where a lot more work is needed to improve access to quality medical care, it is in many countries of Africa. As a result, we are focusing on Africa. We believe we can quickly enhance access to quality medical care across Africa.

An important challenge was to ensure that our model is very scalable so we can quickly and sustainably launch anywhere our solutions are needed most. This means we can deploy and start something almost anywhere in Africa right away.

Yet, we have a lot to build and automate. We have a lot more to learn and fine-tune as we continue to deploy our core solutions. 

We are inviting every medical facility to let us know how we can help them do better. Every medical facility can reach out and tell us what they need most so we can work together and possibly help them have access to it either right away or soon enough.

We are equally inviting partner organizations such as vendors in pharma and biotech and financial institutions who believe in our mission to join us.

We are also hiring. We are inviting people who are passionate about improving access to quality medical care and who believe they can work to make this happen to reach out to us.

MedNeed empowers medical care providers with convenient payment solutions for the things they need to provide quality medical care. At MedNeed, we are relentlessly focused on helping improve outcomes at medical facilities and reduce stress for medical professionals. We are obsessed with whatever will help medical facilities and professionals provide quality medical care for more people.

We believe that as we make it easier and faster for medical care providers to have the things they need for their patients from the right source, we will greatly increase the availability and use of genuine medical products in more communities while removing unnecessary costs. This naturally translates to overall more affordable and timely medical care in more communities and better health outcomes for more families.
