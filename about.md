MedNeed helps fill the need for quality medicines in communities by enabling medical facilities to buy and deliver medicines from distributors and manufacturers through a convenient and efficient process. MedNeed empowers medical facilities in communities with access to quality medicines they need for improved medical care delivery. 

Africa accounted for about 42% of all fake medications reported to the WHO between 2013 and 2020. Estimates from World Health Organization (WHO) show that about 274 deaths occur every day in Africa as a result of fake medication. And too many medical facilities experience significant difficulties getting the medical products they need when they need it.

There are many ways to ensure the use of quality medicines and to fight fake medicines in communities. Among these is encouraging and forcing people to buy and sell only quality medicines and providing incentives for people to do so. Another effective way is to make quality medicines readily available and easily accessible. This is what MedNeed is doing. 

Through the MedNeed network, we fill in gaps in the supply chain to enable more medical facilities have access to genuine medicines from certified distributors and manufacturers using a sustainable process.

Medical facilities of different sizes can work with MedNeed. However, we focus more on smaller medical facilities and providers at the primary care level who usually have the initial contacts with many patients locally. These are also more likely to use sub-standard medical products or not have essential medical products available at all. As such, they have more need of improved access to quality medicines.

We believe that as we make it easier and faster for providers to have the medicines they need for their patients from the right source, we will greatly increase the availability and use of genuine medical products in more communities while removing unnecessary costs. This naturally translates to better health outcomes and overall more affordable and timely medical care for more families and communities.
