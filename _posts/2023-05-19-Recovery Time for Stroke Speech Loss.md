While the timeline will vary from one person to the next, the first few weeks will see the most significant progress when it comes to speech recovery, says Parneet Grewal, M.D., an assistant professor in the department of neurology at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston. 

Progress should continue after that, with the most dramatic improvements in the first three months. But improvements can even be seen even a year out, or more, she says.
