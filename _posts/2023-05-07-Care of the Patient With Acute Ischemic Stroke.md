<!-- Excerpt here before second image below -->

The year 2020 was the year of the nurse, celebrating nurse scholarship, innovation, and leadership while commemorating the founder of modern nursing, Florence Nightingale. This recognition is timely as nurses demonstrate their immeasurable contributions and courage on the front lines caring for patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). 

Although these are uncertain times, the spirit of nursing has not wavered, thrusting a spotlight on the heroic stories of healing, commitment, innovation, and leadership. Nurses conserve Nightingaleâ€™s legacy by promoting scientific nursing research, improving nursing practice, advancing nursing education, and providing leadership to influence health policy. Scientific nursing guidelines provide a body of knowledge assisting nurses in addressing complex health needs and promoting quality care.
