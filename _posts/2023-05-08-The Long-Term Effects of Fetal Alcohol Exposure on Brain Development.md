A recent study investigated the effects of fetal alcohol exposure on brain development in neonatal mice. 

The study found that ethanol-induced neonatal apoptosis often causes immediate neuron deficits that persist into adulthood. Some brain regions are more vulnerable to ethanol-induced neuron loss than others, with the anterior thalamic nuclei showing the greatest loss of neurons.
