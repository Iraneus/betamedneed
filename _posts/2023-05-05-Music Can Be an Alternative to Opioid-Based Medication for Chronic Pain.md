Music has been suggested as a complementary alternative to chronic pain medication. A new study examines the experience of a woman with chronic pain who used music for pain management. The study delves into the contextual aspects of music listening, as well as the physiological and cognitive benefits of music listening.

The study suggests that music-induced analgesia involves complex cognitive and emotional mechanisms, which may modulate the descending pain modulatory pathway.

Key Facts:

The case study highlights how a woman found relief from chronic pain through listening to music after discontinuing her opioid-based treatment.    
The participantâ€™s experience suggests that music-induced analgesia involves cognitive and emotional mechanisms, such as the descending pain modulatory pathway, and that it may be possible to reduce the use of pain medication.
Therapeutic accompaniment, which involves a mediating figure between the patient and the institution, may be useful in helping patients reorient their subjectivity and follow their experiences during the treatment.
