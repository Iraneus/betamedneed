The CDC published a report in April stating that COVID is associated with increased risk for stroke, and disproportionately higher rates of COVID-19 experienced by Black individuals could have increased the disproportionate increase in the Black stroke death rate. 
The American Stroke Association has also cited a Nature Medicine study that found a 52% increased risk of stroke among COVID-19 survivors, or about four more strokes per 1,000 people, a year after contracting the virus.
