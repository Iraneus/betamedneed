<!-- Excerpt here before second image below -->

A 40-year-old man whose legs are paralyzed is able to climb stairs, move over ramps and switch from standing to walking, thanks to implants in his brain and spinal cord that pair with external devices to translate his thoughts into movement.
Maybe someday, technologies like this could help more patients with movement challenges.
