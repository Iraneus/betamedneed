# Collaboration for neuroregeneration and stroke research
 
We are building a benchmark multimodal dataset of biomarkers and molecular entities involved in neurogeneration and stroke recovery. We are then applying an LLM-based system for identification and generation of potential molecules and therapies to enhance neuroregeneration and stroke recovery. Join us if you are a life scientist or clinician with any interest in neurology or stroke treatment.
