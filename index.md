# Collaboration for Neuroregeneration and Stroke Research
 
We are building a resource for multimodal datasets of biomarkers and molecular entities involved in neuroregeneration and stroke treatment for use in the identification and generation of novel molecules and therapeutic options to enhance neuroregeneration and stroke recovery. Join us if you are a life scientist or clinician with any interest in neurology or stroke treatment.
