Clinicians need new medicines to better treat conditions with existing treatments and more importantly, to treat previously untreatable conditions.

In most busy practices, it is difficult for physicians to find the time and make the effort to keep up-to-date with new drug developments. It is even more difficult for physicians in solo practices to review their prescribing practices as recommended in light of the state of the art. 

Medneed enables providers to get updates and quickly learn about newly approved and available medicines from other experienced clinicians and directly from pharma scientists involved in the discovery and development of the drug. 

As a clinician, you have more treatment options, are up-to-date in your specialty and general knowledge of available medicines, follow trends in medicine evaluations and clinical reports that matter to you and your patients, and provide drug developers with feedback on medicines and outcomes to ensure improved information flow between stakeholders in the medicines value chain.
